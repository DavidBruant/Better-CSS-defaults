Better defaults
=================

The story is always the same:
* Someone creates software that works without too much attention to the details (because at the beginning perfect is the enemy of the good)
* People use it, get used to it
* If a default behavior is not the best default, the software creator is posed with a dilemma
    * Break the current default behavior and suffer from [frustrated users](https://xkcd.com/1172/)
    * Keep the current behavior and propose an optional better one.

The repo is a list of code and configuration files that try to promote better defaults by listing and documenting them.

# CSS

Preferably used inlined before any other CSS file/&lt;style>.
